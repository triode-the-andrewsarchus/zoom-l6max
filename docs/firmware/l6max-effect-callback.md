# L6max 1.10 effect callback investigation

This is a partial map for the L6max MAIN image with SHA-256
`980d92272c1f84bed200b4d2f83575202f6a00082c928d99b9e8b53af8d44461`.
It is not a specification for L6 or another firmware revision, and does not
qualify a patch for hardware. The `dual-efx` builder remains disabled; see
[safety status](../dual-efx-safety-status.md).

## Observed callback dispatch

The stock call at `0x8000277c` reaches relocated code at `0x20280580`.
That routine selects an effect descriptor and updates parameters and callbacks;
it is not the 16-frame audio callback assumed by the original patch. The
descriptor table observed at `0x2028b8c0` has five 28-byte entries. Its first
words were, in table order:

| Entry | Callback pointer observed | Stock selector observation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `0x20281649` | Before EFX SEL presses in a setup-complete boot |
| 1 | `0x20280ab9` | After one EFX SEL press |
| 2 | `0x20282221` | After two EFX SEL presses |
| 3 | `0x8002c041` | Not tested in this observation |
| 4 | `0x20280781` | Not tested in this observation |

The active callback pointer is at `0x202a6f20`. Static inspection shows a
wrapper at `0x202800e8` loading that pointer and calling it at `0x20280248`.
Before the call, the wrapper scales a 64-element input array at `0x20010210`
and copies the same samples into both 64-element scratch channels; afterward
it copies the two scratch channels back with the inverse scale. This observed
wrapper therefore does not expose separate per-channel sends. The
effect code for table entries 1 and 2 also contains 64-iteration floating-point
processing loops. The one- and two-press progression is consistent with Room
and Spring in the documented selector sequence; nonzero audio behavior and
other starting states require further runtime tests.

In a stock headless run, a GDB breakpoint at `0x20280248` stopped immediately
before the indirect call. Registers were `r0=0x804683a4`, `r1=0x8045fe98`,
`r2=0x202a6f3c`, and `r12=0x20281649`. At that stop, `r1 + 4` held
`0x202a6f3c`; this is the first of the wrapper's two 64-float scratch arrays.
These arguments point to descriptors and scratch, not the two interleaved
32-float buffers asserted by the old patch. The recorded sample values were
zero, so this observation does not prove nonzero signal routing or audio
fidelity.

## Candidate channel accumulation loop

A write watchpoint on the first input word `0x20010210` stopped in a
floating-point fill routine at `0x202300cc`, called from `0x20228ac0`.
Static inspection of the caller shows it clearing 128 floats beginning at
`0x20010210` and then iterating over 12 entries. Both branches of the loop
multiply 64 samples per entry and accumulate into the first 64-float region;
one also uses a per-sample multiplier. The sample source addresses in that
loop are `0x2000e410 + entry * 0x100`. This is a candidate place to obtain
separate send contributions, not yet a validated insertion point: the entry
mapping, gain semantics, thread ownership, ordering and output destinations
must still be confirmed with nonzero inputs and controls.

The watched stop used a fresh emulator state and stock MAIN; its observed
return address was `0x20228ac5` and QEMU stopped at `0x202300cc`. Captured
256-byte regions at `0x20228a80` and `0x20230080` matched MAIN file offsets
`0xfd4c8` and `0x104ac8` respectively. The watchpoint log SHA-256 was
`2c22a4b249db9e4bf7c8fad99a5ab7b5643d26709bdfe1750b90e73d7b9c107a`;
the captures hashed to
`bb643a48ea864c1404f696b0059326651f564df0455c6a9476da9af511d37fa9` and
`192d03418a27ba16f8b6a7ab7e47615a89733bd82271645dd4f34e1dcfb12d3a`.
The log establishes the clear operation, while the channel accumulation is
inferred from the following stock instructions.

## Evidence and limits

- QEMU binary SHA-256:
  `9724d60a31400becad8f1e98d6fd67bb9456c8dfbdeebe833e7636ed8e9cf536`.
  The `l6test` runner records its source provenance as unattested.
- Stock package SHA-256:
  `4e20f92c9c5131ed082c0feec2b2d7d0445fb576296f11f6dace56a4fc0c9b47`.
  The state spec SHA-256 was
  `d3dedc75d71014f1cc59cb35e04ce377214369812b4f5662697dd8d6c36ee485`.
- The headless stock `audio-path` case passed with those inputs. It establishes
  callback and SAI/eDMA observations, not effect output.
- A separate hash-guarded `l6dbg` memory recipe captured `0x20280500` for
  4,096 bytes after 10 guest seconds. The capture matched bytes at MAIN file
  offset `0x105370` throughout. A second recipe read the descriptor table and
  active state; a GDB stop observed the indirect call during a stock boot.
- The recipe and diagnostic JSON hashes for the table capture were
  `daf9ae1876775bd8ff7a8b6862aa93475e767be34dcead45fe2874d81176c29d` and
  `63c54db0e60edfd4736a35b091ee8d562605f7886d5930dd7624139357ca5b50`.
  Local logs and captured firmware remain outside version control.
- A separate diagnostic waited 45 guest seconds, pressed EFX SEL twice with a
  two-second guest-time interval, and read the active descriptor before and
  after each press. The recipe and result hashes were
  `1e7f6cf442730f82da89089a0ace47fef6f32a86705f63becaa06fc19bce5666` and
  `9b437be3551f1d36651fb9073539bc77c97d57f18b7057e80581f37245fe0607`.

Next, establish the exact per-channel send accumulation point, each table
entry's effect selection, callback lifetime and synchronization, and the
scratch format with nonzero signal. Also prove target memory ownership and
worst-case timing before changing or enabling firmware hooks.
